=>     AI Dev Mentor

AI Dev Mentor is an experimental AI-powered coding mentor built as a VS Code extension.
It is designed to guide developers while coding, explain concepts, and suggest professional improvements — just like having a personal AI mentor inside your editor.

🌟 Vision

The goal of AI Dev Mentor is not just to auto-complete code, but to teach developers best practices while they write. Instead of replacing developers, it aims to empower learning and make coding more structured, professional, and fun.

🚀 Key Features

📝 Explain on Hover / Double Click → Instantly get clear explanations for keywords across languages (JS, HTML, CSS, Python, etc.)

💬 Friendly Mentor Mode → AI behaves like a mentor, giving logical, structured guidance instead of just answers

🔍 Code Block Explanation → Select code and get a deep, line-by-line explanation

♻️ Refactor Suggestions → Detects bad practices and suggests cleaner alternatives

⚡ Panel Compiler → A dedicated in-editor chat panel powered by AI (Gemini / other APIs)

🔄 Memory + Context (in progress) → AI that remembers your session history

🌍 Web Search Integration (planned) → For real-time coding knowledge

🎯 Why AI Dev Mentor?

Most coding AI tools (like Copilot) focus only on completion. AI Dev Mentor is built with a teaching-first approach:

It saves you from searching docs repeatedly

It helps you understand why something works

It keeps your coding aligned with industry best practices

📌 Current Status

Prototype working with Gemini 1.5 Flash API

Panel compiler + mentor mode integrated

Roadmap includes memory, web search, and scaling improvements

🔮 Future Roadmap

 Add persistent memory for long-term context

 Integrate live web search

 Optimize for scaling (multi-user support, session handling)

 Enhance UI/UX of the mentor panel

 Introduce plugin marketplace for custom mentor personalities
